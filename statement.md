# Project Statement

## 1. Problem Statement
In many colleges and local communities, students and residents frequently travel to common destinations such as railway stations, bus stops, nearby towns, or specific areas. Often multiple people travel the same route but do not know who else is going. This results in unnecessary extra expenses, empty vehicle seats, and lack of coordination for shared travel.

There is a need for a simple platform where people can offer available seats in their vehicle and others can easily discover and book them.

## 2. Scope of the Project
This project provides a basic ride-sharing system focused on enabling users to:

- Offer a ride by submitting ride details such as starting point, destination, date, time, available seats, and fare.
- View all offered rides in a clean and user-friendly interface.
- Check ride details before final selection.
- Book available seats, reducing the seat count dynamically.
- Automatically hide rides that are fully booked.

The current scope includes basic functionality and front-end and back-end integration. Future scope includes authentication, database storage, notifications, and advanced route suggestions.
